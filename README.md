## Summary

  This is a automated data pipeline workflow performing **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using **Python** programming language with the help of **Pandas** library where data is processed by **Spark** parallel data processing engine

  Relational database **PostgresSQL** acting as _Data Warehouse_ and NoSQL database **ElasticSearch** with **Kibana** dashboard as _Datalake_, along with that 
  _csv_ and _json_ data files acting as multiple data sources

  Data pipeline managemet tool **Apache Airflow** is used to create and manage automated data workflow efficiently with help of **DAG** Python, Bash Operators
